  <p>I am a third year PhD student in the <a href= "https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-human-centered-computing">Human-Centered Computing (HCC) </a> program at Georgia Tech. I am a member of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/riarriaga/lab?authuser=0"> Georgia Tech Ubicomp Health & Wellness Lab</a>, advised by Professor Rosa Arriaga. Previously, I received my B.S. in electrical engineering (Georgia Tech), worked as an avionics engineer, and received my M.S. in computer science specializing in human-computer interaction (Georgia Tech). <br /><br />
  My research focuses on <strong> equitable health technologies</strong> which incorporate AI for chronic health management, especially for historically marginalized communities. I conduct <strong>qualitative</strong> research, utilizing <strong>community-based approaches</strong>, and work with multidisciplinary teams to bridge design, human-computer interaction, and medicine. My work has been funded by the American Diabetes Association, the NIH, and the NSF.

  Most recently, I have been exploring medical mistrust and institutional distrust within communities of older Black Americans with low income, to inform the design of diabetes mobile health technologies which validate this historically-grounded, protective response.
