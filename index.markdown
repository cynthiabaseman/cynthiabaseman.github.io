  <p>I am a third year PhD student in the <a href= "https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-human-centered-computing">Human-Centered Computing (HCC) </a> program at Georgia Tech. I am a member of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/riarriaga/lab?authuser=0"> Georgia Tech Ubicomp Health & Wellness Lab</a>, advised by Professor Rosa Arriaga. Previously, I received my B.S. in electrical engineering (Georgia Tech), worked as an electronics avionics engineer, and received my M.S. in computer science specializing in human-computer interaction (Georgia Tech).</p>

<div style="display: flex; padding:50px; border-box;">
<p> My research focuses on equitable health technologies which incorporate AI for chronic health management, especially for historically marginalized communities. I conduct qualitative research, utilizing community-based approaches, and work with multidisciplinary teams to bridge design, human-computer interaction, and medicine. Most recently, I have been exploring medical mistrust and institutional distrust within communities of older Black Americans with low income, to inform the design of diabetes mobile health technologies which validate this historically-grounded, protective response. </p>
